    <h1>Privacy Policy for StockIntel Automated Email Pipeline</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        StockIntel Automated Email Pipeline ("the App") automates the sending 
        of stock sentiment summaries through the user's Gmail account. 
        This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, 
        how it is used, and what is never collected or stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Information the App Accesses</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses Google's OAuth authorization to send email through the 
        Gmail API. The following permissions may be requested:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Send email on behalf of the user</strong>  
            (scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information the App Does NOT Access</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read any existing emails in the user's inbox</li>
        <li>Access email metadata, contacts, or labels</li>
        <li>Store any personal information on external servers</li>
        <li>Collect user activity data or analytics</li>
        <li>Share or sell any information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Processing Only</h2>
    <p>
        All email content generated by the App is produced locally within 
        the user’s environment. No content is transmitted to external 
        servers other than Gmail for the purpose of sending email.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage of Credentials</h2>
    <p>
        OAuth tokens are stored locally on the user’s machine. 
        They are never uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not share any data with external vendors, advertisers, 
        or analytics services.
    </p>
